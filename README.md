# Machine Learning Notebooks
A collection of jupyter notebooks, used for learning and implementing ML algorithms. Most of the notes can be regarded as notes from the literature rather than original work.

### Artificial Neurons
In this notebook, I implement a __Perception__ learning algorithm and discuss its limitations. As a natural extension I implement __Adaptive Linear Neurons__ and __Stochastic Gradient Descent__. This is a _"from scratch"_ implementation, using only numpy and native Python.

### Classifiers Using scikit-learn.
In this notebook, some of the most popular supervised learning algorithms for classifications are tested, using the __scikit-learn__ API. The examples hightlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms. Examples include:

* Regularization 
* Logistic regression
* Support vector machines (with and withouth kernel tricks)
* Decision trees
* Random forests
* K nearest neighbors

### Data Preprocessing
In this notebook I discuss different preprocessing techniques to facilitate good data to machine learning models. Topics will include:

* Removing and imputing missing values from the dataset
* Getting categorical data into shape for ML algorithms
* Selecting relevant features for the model construction


## Python Modules/Dependencies
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* scikitlearn
* ...
