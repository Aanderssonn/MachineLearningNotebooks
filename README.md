# Machine Learning Notebooks
A collection of jupyter notebooks, used for learning and implementing ML algorithms.

### Artificial Neurons
In this notebook, I implement a __Perception__ learning algorithm and discuss its limitations. As a natural extension I implement __Adaptive Linear Neurons__ and __Stochastic Gradient Descent__. This is a _"from scratch"_ implementation, using only numpy and native Python.

### Classifiers Using scikit-learn.
In this notebook, some of the most popular supervised learning algorithms for classifications are tested, using the __scikit-learn__ API. The examples hightlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms. Examples include:

* Regularization 
* Logistic regression
* Support vector machines (with and withouth kernel tricks)
* Decision trees
